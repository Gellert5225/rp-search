# Search Interfaces for Robot Programming Exercise 4

This repository contains search interfaces, some small helper classes and some test problems which you can use in Exercise 4. 

To use this code in your project you first need to clone the project into your Eclipse workspace. The following assumes you use the directory `~/workspace` as your Eclipse workspace as it is the default value. If this is not true, then replace this directory with the correct one for you. 

1. Open a terminal
2. Change into your workspace directory: `cd ~/workspace`
3. Clone this project using Git: `git clone https://github.com/hawesie/rp-search`
4. In Eclipse, create a new new Java project with the name `rp-search`. This shold automatically find the sources you just cloned.
